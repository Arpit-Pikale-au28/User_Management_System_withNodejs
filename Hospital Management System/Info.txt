A completely working project based on a Hospital Management System Node JS with MongoDB. It comes with a lot of useful features that enable users to keep track of
their healthcare data, transactions, and more. This system, as well as the web application, has a clear idea that is similar to real-life circumstances and
well-implemented.

The administrator, on the other hand, has complete control over the system. He or she has access to all of the hospital’s records. Patients, physicians, their
departments, treatment kinds, and medical records may all be managed by an admin. An administrator has the authority to create a doctor’s account.
The administrator must also set up the doctor’s account under several hospital departments. The appointment records may also be seen by the administrator. 
In addition, the administrative assistant must keep billing records for each patient’s therapy. The user must input the discount amount and the justification 
for it in order to keep track of each patient’s payment. After making a payment, the patient may access their own accounts and check all of their reports.

Finally, for a better user experience when using this Hospital Management System Project in NodeJS, a clean and basic dashboard is displayed with simple color 
choices. Materialize uses a current responsive CSS framework for its UI components, as well as some Vanilla CSS. Presenting a new Node JS MongoDB project for an
online hospital management system that comprises an admin panel with patient and doctor panels.
